                                    Fenix was a member of the templar caste, the caste that composes the protoss military. He trained and
                                    ascended the ranks alongside his friends and legendary warriors, Artanis and Tassadar. Fenix eventually
                                    rose to the rank of praetor, a high ranking military leadership position. For most of his time as a
                                    templar Fenix fought as a zealot and on the frontlines, an abnormality for templar of his rank. Zealots
                                    are warriors who fight in hand-to-hand combat with psionic blades and are the basis of any formidable
                                    protoss military. Before the Great War, Fenix fought against multiple terrorist groups, hunting down and
                                    killing every member of one of them, and commanded military excursions. This ultimately led to Fenix
                                    becoming the praetor of the Protoss Defense Force.

                                    When the zerg invaded Aiur, Fenix still held his position as praetor of the Protoss Defense Force. He was
                                    positioned in the province Antioch to defend a strategic outpost and with the help of the playerâ€™s self
                                    insert executor, they fought off the zerg incursion. Later in the war Fenix is once again positioned in
                                    Antioch and the zerg launch another attack. This time, however, Fenix is maimed by the zerg. Following
                                    the battle, Fenix's ravaged body was recovered and he was installed into a dragoon exo-skeleton. In his
                                    new form, with the return of Tassadar, Fenix helps in the rebellion against the protoss Conclave. Joining
                                    Tassadar and Zeratul, they destroy Kor-shakal, but are ultimately defeated when Tassadar surrenders to
                                    the Conclave to stop the bloodshed. Fenix later helped act as a distraction while Zeratul assaulted a
                                    pair of zerg cerebrates and joined in the battle against the zerg Overmind. Following the defeat of the
                                    Overmind, Fenix allied with the human Jim Raynor to evacuate protoss civilians from the ensuing chaos.
                                    Later Fenix and Raynor formed a temporary alliance with the Queen of Blades to liberate the sector of
                                    earth-born human invaders. During their liberation of Korhal, the Queen of Blades betrayed the duo and
                                    Fenix was killed by the zerg swarm.

                                    During the End War(the war against Amon) Artanis, the hierarch(leader) of the Protoss Protectorate(theDaelaam),
                                    recovered a prototype purifier warrior from Glacius. <a href="https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Purifier">The
                                        Purifier Program</a> was a military research program conducted by the protoss Conclave in the far past.
                                        It aimed to create an army of artificially intelligent robots built from the cloned consciousnesses of
                                        great protoss warriors. The Conclave treated them as slaves, however, which incited a rebellion. The
                                        rebellion was quelled and the purifiers were locked in stasis. Later on the Conclave revived the purifier
                                        program in secret for pure research purposes on the planet Glacius. At some point between the beginning
                                        of the Great War and the zerg invasion of Aiur Fenix went to Glacius where his brain was scanned. This
                                        brain-scanned personality is what was installed in the prototype purifier warrior that Artanis recovered.
                                        At first, the warrior believed itself to be Fenix, but gaps in its memory of the events that happened
                                        after the brain-scan soon came to light. Seeing that he and Fenix's memory had diverted, the warrior
                                        decided to name himself Talandar and forge his own identity. By the end of the End War Talandar was
                                        the Commander of the Purifiers(as they were brought out of stasis during the End War).
